# semantic-refactor
AS A software developer
I WANT to change a working, functional webpage 
SO THAT it has more accessibility and semantic elements in the code

I specified the header and the navigation bar. I also used main to point to the three main boxes of content on the left, and used aside to describe the three boxes to the right. 

I used simple alt attributes to genereally describe the composition of the images, how it was framed, and not necessarily the finer details of the image to retain brevity.
